This project explores the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Inspired by the principles of natural selection, this algorithm evolves optimal solutions to complex logistical challenges.

# Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

This project implements a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** solver using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**. Inspired by nature's principles of evolution, this approach optimizes routes for vehicles to minimize travel costs and enhance efficiency in logistics.

## üöÄ Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Uses natural selection principles with selection, crossover, and mutation strategies.
- **Custom Fitness Evaluation**: Designed to prioritize shorter, balanced, and practical routes.
- **Visualization**: Leverages Matplotlib to visualize optimized routes and evaluate performance.
- **Experimentation**: Includes parameter tuning and comparisons of genetic strategies.

## üìñ How It Works
1. **Population Initialization**: Starts with a population of potential solutions (routes).
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Assigns a score to each route based on distance and efficiency.
3. **Selection**: Chooses the best-performing routes to create a new generation.
4. **Crossover**: Combines parts of selected routes to create offspring.
5. **Mutation**: Randomly alters some routes to introduce diversity.
6. **Repeat**: The process continues until convergence or a set number of generations.

## üîç Results
- **Efficiency**: Demonstrated significant improvement in route optimization over generations.
- **Visualization**: See optimized routes and performance trends using Matplotlib charts.
